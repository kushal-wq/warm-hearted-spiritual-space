The term 'Advaita' refers to the idea that the soul (true Self, Atman) and the Absolute (Brahman) are one and the same.\n\nAccording to this philosophy, the perceived duality between individual consciousness and universal consciousness is an illusion (Maya). The ultimate goal is to transcend this illusion through spiritual practices that lead to direct realization of one's true nature.\n\nIn this teaching, we will delve into the core principles of Advaita Vedanta as expounded by its most famous exponent, Adi Shankaracharya. We will discuss concepts such as Brahman, Maya, and the path to self-realization through knowledge (jnana).\n\nUnderstanding these principles can transform your perspective on existence and lead to profound inner peace and freedom from suffering.",

Understanding your unique doshic constitution is key to creating a lifestyle that supports your natural tendencies and addresses imbalances.\n\nIn this teaching, we will explore how Ayurvedic principles can be applied to modern living, including daily routines (dinacharya), seasonal practices (ritucharya), nutrition, exercise, and stress management appropriate for different constitutional types.\n\nBy incorporating these ancient practices into your contemporary lifestyle, you can enhance your physical health, mental clarity, and spiritual well-being in a way that honors your individual nature and needs.",
