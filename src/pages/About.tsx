                <p className="text-spiritual-brown/80">
                  From a very young age, our priest demonstrated a profound connection to the spiritual realm. 
                  Born into a family with deep religious roots, he began his formal spiritual education at the age of eight, 
                  studying ancient texts and learning traditional rituals under the guidance of respected spiritual masters.
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-spiritual-brown/80">
                  After completing his formal studies, he embarked on a journey of self-discovery, spending several years in 
                  deep meditation and contemplation in the Himalayan mountains. This period of intense spiritual practice 
                  transformed his understanding and allowed him to connect with divine wisdom in a profound way.
